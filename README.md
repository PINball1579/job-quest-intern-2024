# job-quest-intern-2024

Hi all applicants! Welcome to OrangeCap Internship Program 2024. Being an intern at OrangeCap is challenging so we have challenges for you! These challenges are designed to assess your learning skill, which is the fundamental and most important skill of a great software developer. So I do not expect you to have full or any knowledge about the topic beforehand but it's your job to try to learn and answer those challenges.

***Please fork this repo and work on the test. After finishing the test, please send your repo to chatchawan@orangecapinnovative.com***

# Bracket Matcher

  Write a function `bracketMatcher` that receives a string. The function will return a number. If there is the brackets are correctly matched and each one is accounted for. Otherwise, return 0
  
**Example**
```javascript
> bracketMatcher("(hello (world))")
1

> bracketMatcher("(hello (world)))")
0
```

# SecondMax
  Write a function `secondMax` that receives an array of numbers. The function will return the second maximum value of the array. If there is no second max, return max instead. If an array is empty, throw and error.

**Example**

```javascript
> secondMax([2, 3, 4, 5])
4

> secondMax([9, 2, 21, 21])
9

> secondMax([4, 4, 4, 4])
4

> secondMax([4123])
4123

> secondMax([])
Error!
```
